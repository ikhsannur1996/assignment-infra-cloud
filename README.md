### Detailed Components

#### Frontend

1. **Google Cloud Storage**: 
   - Host static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the web application interface.
   - Ensure proper configuration for public access and efficient content delivery.

2. **Firebase Authentication**:
   - Manage user authentication and authorization.
   - Provide secure login, registration, and session management using Firebase SDKs.

#### Backend

1. **Cloud Run**:
   - Deploy a RESTful API using frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).
   - Containerize the application with Docker and deploy it on Cloud Run for scalability and automatic scaling based on traffic.

2. **Cloud SQL**:
   - Set up a Cloud SQL instance with MySQL or PostgreSQL to store employee data, attendance records, payroll information, and other HR data.
   - Implement secure connections and proper IAM roles for database access.

3. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Store employee documents (e.g., contracts, performance reviews) in Cloud Storage buckets.
   - Ensure secure access controls and efficient organization of files.

4. **BigQuery**:
   - Use BigQuery for advanced analytics and reporting.
   - Analyze HR data to generate insights on employee performance, attendance patterns, payroll summaries, and more.

### Conclusion

This simplified architecture meets the requirements of our HRIS web application while offering several benefits. By leveraging Google Cloud Platform services, we can build a scalable, secure, and efficient solution that streamlines HR processes and enhances employee management. The architecture provides cost-effective scalability, data-driven insights, robust security, and compliance with data protection regulations, ensuring the successful implementation and growth of our HRIS platform.
